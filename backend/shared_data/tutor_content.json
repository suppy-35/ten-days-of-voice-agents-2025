There are different types: for loops repeat a specific number of times, while loops repeat until a condition is false, and foreach loops iterate over collections. Loops save time and reduce code duplication.",

Functions help organize code, prevent repetition, make debugging easier, and improve readability. They can take parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).",
